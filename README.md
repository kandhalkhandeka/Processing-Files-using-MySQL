# Processing-Files-using-MySQL
This is a repository for a task assigned to me by Bilateral solutions!

Task: Make Folders named Processing,queue and process and Write a code that makes a file(txt) every second in the Processing folder, picks up all the files from processing and moves all the files to queue every 5 seconds. It then picks files from the queue folder and updates a column in MySQL/mongoDB table as 0/1 and moves the file to the Processed folder
Also, make sure that no files are moved from Processing to queue until the queue folder is empty.
